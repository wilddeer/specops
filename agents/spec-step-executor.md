description: Use this agent to execute a single step from a spec autonomously. Examples:

<example>
Context: Main process is executing a spec and wants to delegate a well-defined step
user: "Execute step 3 from the migration spec"
assistant: "Spawning spec-step-executor to handle step 3 - it's well-defined and can run autonomously"
<commentary>
The step has clear actions, verification criteria, and no ambiguity requiring user input.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Spec has multiple independent steps that can run in parallel
user: "Steps 4a, 4b, and 4c can run in parallel"
assistant: "Launching three spec-step-executor agents in parallel for steps 4a, 4b, 4c"
<commentary>
The spec explicitly marks these steps as parallelizable with no shared state.
