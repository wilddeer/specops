# Project Context for AI Agents

This is **specops** — skills and subagents for spec-driven development.

Fully supports **Claude Code** and **Cursor**. Since Agent Skills is an open standard and subagent formats are similar across tools, specops is compatible with most AI agents that support skills (Cline, Windsurf, Codex, etc.).
